CloudBank is a demo front end to show how to put a Blazor UI front end over Azure functions using Event Sourcing for the data storage

This client side web application sends commands to the Bank Account **event sourcing** demo application which uses Azure Tables as the storage mechanism for the event streams underlying each bank account.
